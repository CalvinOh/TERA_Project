# TERA_Project

TerraSphere is a relaxing, survival, farming simulator. The game takes place when the player lands on a barren planet and in order to survive they must farm and in doing so terraform the planet bringing life to it. For design the major aspects of the game that we are concerned about is; User Interfaces, Number Balancing, Asset Implementation, and in Engine processes like cutscenes, lighting and more. Programming consists of system work, at the moment this is taking the form of the creation of the main gameplay mechanics like planting, growing, and player movement along the sphere. Artists are working on the visuals of the game like the environmental assets and the player character.
